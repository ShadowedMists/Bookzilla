#Exercises

##Book Search Needs to Search by ISBN
The client has requested that the book search on the homepage be able to search on ISBN number. Implement the new feature on the book search stored procedure.

##Book Search Should Only Show In-Stock Items
The client has asked that the book search on the homepage should only show in-stock books by default. They still want to be able to search on out of stock items though. Update the Book Search stored procedure to include a new flag only show in-stock items. Update the homepage to include a new checkbox to search on in-stock items only and pass the value to the stored procedure.

##Resolve the Delete Book Foreign Key Error
The client has noted that ever since the Book Inventory functionality was implemented the delete function stopped working. Investigate and resolve.

Bonus Points: Implement the Book Delete function with a stored procedure.
